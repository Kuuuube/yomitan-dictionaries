# Yomitan Dictionaries

A collection of Yomitan dictionaries created or modified by me. Check out [MarvNC's Dictionaries](https://github.com/MarvNC/yomichan-dictionaries) for a more general list.

## JPDB v2.1 Frequency

Frequency list scraped from JPDB's enormous corpus of Japanese media.

Coverage of the corpus is 99.5% up to 25000, 99% up to 70000, and 98% up to 100000. This far exceeds the coverage of the original JPDB frequency dictionary.

**Quality:** High

### JPDB v2.1 Frequency Kana Display Only (Recommended)

Displays the frequency of the word and the frequency of the word being written in kana (denoted by `㋕`). But does not use the kana frequency internally.

This version is suitable to be used as a frequency sorting dictionary.

**Preview:** `読む` -> `JPDBv2㋕ 395, 19886㋕`, `よむ` -> `JPDBv2㋕ 19886㋕`

### JPDB v2.1 Frequency

Only displays the frequency of the exact word. Does not display the frequency of the word being written in kana.

**Preview:** `読む` -> `JPDBv2 395`

**Download:** [JPDB v2.1](https://github.com/Kuuuube/yomitan-dictionaries/raw/main/dictionaries/JPDB_v2.1_2024-05-26.zip)

### JPDB v2.1 Frequency Kana

Displays the frequency of the word and the frequency of the word being written in kana (denoted by `㋕`). Matches the format of the original JPDB frequency dictionary.

**Preview:** `読む` -> `JPDBv2㋕ 395, 19886㋕`, `よむ` -> `JPDBv2㋕ 19886㋕`

## BCCWJ SUW LUW Combined

BCCWJ SUW and BCCWJ LUW combined into one dictionary to save space on the Yomitan popup.

**Quality:** High

**Preview:** `読む` -> `BCCWJ 292, 375`

## H Frequency

Frequency dictionary created using data from 13000 H work voice scripts. Much smaller corpus than other frequency lists.

**Quality:** Medium

**Preview:** `読む` -> `H Freq 976`

## JMdict Frequency

Frequency dictionary created based off of the data used by JMdict's news frequency tags. This is included just for reference and I recommend against using it.

JMdict has great word meaning/definition data but their frequency data is terrible.

**Quality:** Low
